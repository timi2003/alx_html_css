Implement a design from scratch

In this project, i implemented from scratch, without any library, a web page. i used all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Interactions note:

the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
links hover/active: #FF6565
button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
create a README.md file 


1. Header


2. "What we do..." section
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.


3. "Our results" section
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the “Our results” section

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!


4. Contact us
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

5. Footer
mandatory
Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:


6. Replace background image with... code!
mandatory
In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.


7. Let's animate items
mandatory
From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!
